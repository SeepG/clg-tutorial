This repository is for practicing C# assignments from Code Like Girl 10-week mentor led tutorial, December 2021 batch. 

### Setup dependencies:
- Please download relevant SDK as per your machine: Windows or Mac
- Download code editor of your choice, I've used Visual Studio Code (VS code) editor
- Also install C# extension in VS code for helping us writing the code.

### Test the step-up
- You can test the setup by running following commands:

- Open new terminal and create a empty directory eg: mkdir clg-tutorial 
- Cd into the clg-tutorial and type `dotnet new console`
- Now you will have few folders inside your main directory. Open `Program.cs` file and update the line which says hello world to one written below: 
Console.WriteLine("Goodbye, World!");
- Save the file and type `dotnet build`
- Then type `dotnet run` and you will get output Goodbye, World!

Congratulations, your setup is working. Let's now work through lessons.
