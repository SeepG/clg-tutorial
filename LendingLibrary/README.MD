3. We do not want to create objects of the Media, Book or CD classes. Find a way in your code to avoid this.

4. Finally, create a library class that has 4 properties:

    -  A list of Novels

    -   A list of Textbooks

    -   A list of Albums and 

    -   A list of AudioBooks.

5. Bonus tasks - If you complete the above task, you can try one of more of these bonus activities: 
    - Can you also find a way to list borrowers at the library?
    - Can you find a way to make this interactive, so that a library admin can add books to the system? `TO BE DONE`
