# COURSE COORDINATOR

### ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
The activity is to create an application to help an administrator at a university to manage students and course enrollments

### INSTRUCTIONS
Create an application to help the course coordinator at a university to manage student enrollments.

Allow the user of the application (a course coordinator) to do the following:

- list students at the university

- list the courses on offer at the university

- list the courses each student is enrolled on 

- Enrol more students to the university

- Unenrol students from courses

Bonus task

If you complete this task and have time, adjust your code so that

The program is not case sensitive about the commands it accepts - e.g. “Enrol” and “enrol” are considered the same

It can also enrol specific students on a list of courses and allow the coordinator to add or remove courses from the list each student is enrolled on

It can limit the number of students enrolled on a particular course.
