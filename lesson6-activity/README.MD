### BASIC CALCULATOR

## ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
The aim of this activity is to create a calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic.


## INSTRUCTIONS
- Create a console application that asks the user to enter a number 1 number
- Enter an operation (such as add, divide, raise to the power)
- Enter a second number
- Perform given calculation as per operation
- Your application should allow the user to keep doing as many calculations as they want to.

Example Input:

`4`

Your application should use methods to break up the different functions it performs into logical blocks. For example you could have methods like
