MAD LIBS

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION
Mad Libs is a game where players are asked a series of seemingly random questions, and then their answers are used to create a funny story or script. This activity is to create a single player mad libs game.

### Set up instructions:

- Create a folder for a new application, and call it “Lesson 2 Activity”

- Open this folder in Visual Studio Code

- Create a new console application

### Task:

*Write an application that asks the user for a series of at least 3 words, for example*

- “Mode of transport, e.g. bus, plane, train”

- “Out of the way travel destination”

- “Pick an adverb, e.g. playfully, sadly”

- “Pick a plural noun”

- “What’s your favourite mythical creature?”

- “Pick a superpower”

- Ensure that any extra whitespace at the beginning or end of their answers gets removed

**Write a script that will combine the answers to these questions in a “mad libs” script, and display this to the user using interpolated strings**
